# Changelog — apex-grid

All notable changes to the `apex-grid` (community) package are documented here.
This project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html)
and the format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/).

## [3.0.1] — unreleased

Documentation-only patch (no runtime or API changes).

### Documentation
- Documented the `--ag-grid-shadow` theming hook and the flat-by-default grid
  edge (1px hairline ring; opt back into the elevated card with
  `--ag-grid-shadow: var(--ag-shadow-card)`, or remove it with `none`).
- Added `@cssprop` JSDoc for the public `--ag-*` design tokens (incl.
  `--ag-grid-shadow`) and a `@csspart` entry on the grid root, so the generated
  Custom Elements Manifest / API reference list the theming surface.
- Completed the class `@fires` list — added the row- and tree-expansion events
  (`rowExpanding`, `rowExpanded`, `treeRowExpanding`, `treeRowExpanded`) and
  attached the missing `rowSelecting` event description.
- Corrected the stale "getting started" block in the `ApexGrid` JSDoc: theming
  is via `--ag-*` CSS custom properties (no `configureTheme()` / theme-CSS
  import required).
- Fixed an incorrect package name (`@apexcharts/grid-enterprise` →
  `apex-grid-enterprise`) in export JSDoc.

## [3.0.0] — 2026-06-09

### Changed
- **BREAKING: Excel (XLSX) export removed from core.** It now lives in
  [`apex-grid-enterprise`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/apex-grid-enterprise).
  Core keeps **CSV export** (`exportToCSV`). The toolbar export menu is now
  driven by a generic seam — `exportFormats` getter + `exportAs(formatId, opts)`
  — so derived grids can add formats. Migrate `grid.exportToXLSX(...)` calls by
  switching to `<apex-grid-enterprise>` (see its README).
- **Theming is now CSS-variable based.** The grid styles itself out of the box
  through `--ag-*` custom properties — no theme import or `configureTheme()`
  call is required. When `igniteui-webcomponents` is present, brand tokens
  auto-tint from its palette.
- **Neutral restyle**: grayscale chrome with brand color reserved for state and
  accents.
- **Flat grid edge by default.** The host no longer paints a heavy floating-card
  shadow; it shows a flat 1px hairline edge. Restore the prior look with
  `--ag-grid-shadow: var(--ag-shadow-card)`.

### Project
- Repository converted to an npm-workspaces monorepo; this package publishes
  from `packages/core`.
